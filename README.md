# ssh-audits

## Usage

```GO

To install the package:
go get -u github.com/ChaosHour/ssh-audits

or download the source code:
git clone git@github.com:ChaosHour/ssh-audits.git

What is the best way to run the package?
Replace the ip or fqdn from the hosts.txt and commands from the commands.txt file and run it.

You can use multiple hosts and multiple commands. No spaces in either file.

Did I really need to create this? 
No, not really, but it was fun and I wanted to learn how to do it.

## The main import used for ssh is the ssh package

[GOPH](https://github.com/melbahja/goph) - github.com/melbahja/goph

I used the ssh package to connect to the remote host and execute commands.

```GO
SSH Agent was used to connect to the remote hosts. Example provided by the ssh package.

â˜› Start Connection With SSH Agent (Unix systems only):
auth, err := goph.UseAgent()
if err != nil {
       // handle error
}

client, err := goph.New("root", "192.1.1.3", auth)
```

```GO

To compile this for FreeBSD:

FreeBSD:
env GOOS=freebsd GOARCH=amd64 go build .

On Mac:
env GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build .

```
