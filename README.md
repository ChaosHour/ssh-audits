# ssh-audits

Work is in progress...

## What is it?
So, in the days when I was a Sysadmin I would write a bunch of shell scripts and loop through servers from a list and do stuff.

This is kind of like that now, but with Go and SSH.

Why not just use Ansible or JetPorch from the same creator as Ansible, but it's in Rust?
Good question, I like Ansible and JetPorch, but I wanted to learn how to do this in Go.

## What is New!

I'm re-working the code and adding more features that I think will be useful.

```GO
Install the package:
go install github.com/ChaosHour/ssh-audits@latest

or download the source code:
git clone git@github.com:ChaosHour/ssh-audits.git

What is the best way to run the package?
Replace the ip or fqdn from the hosts.txt and commands from the commands.txt file and run it.

You can use multiple hosts and multiple commands. No spaces in either file.

Did I really need to create this? 
No, not really, but it was fun and I wanted to learn how to do it.

```

```GO
On Mac:
env GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build .
```
