# ssh-audits

Work is in progress...

## What is it?
So, in the days when I was a Sysadmin I would write a bunch of shell scripts and loop through servers from a list and do stuff.

This is kind of like that now, but with Go and SSH.

Why not just use Ansible or JetPorch from the same creator as Ansible, but it's in Rust?
Good question, I like Ansible and JetPorch, but I wanted to learn how to do this in Go.

## What is New!

I'm re-working the code and adding more features that I think will be useful.
